# Coffee Delivery

Application to manage a fictional coffee shop, where I was able to apply the concepts of Context-API to store items in the cart, routing with React router dom and searching for the user location through a third-party API. Developed using React.js, Typescript and Styled Components.

* Shopping Cart
* User Location
* Checkout
* State Management
* ContextAPI
* LocalStorage
